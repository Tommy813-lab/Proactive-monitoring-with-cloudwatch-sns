> 🚨 proactive-monitoring-with-cloudwatch-sns
A real-world AWS lab that shows how to proactively monitor EC2 health using Amazon CloudWatch and send instant alerts via SNS. Designed for Cloud Support Engineers and aspiring SREs, this project helps detect performance degradation before users complain—or worse—before the boss notices. 😅

📘 Scenario
You're a Tier 2 Cloud Support Engineer at a fast-growing SaaS company.
The backend EC2 instances are starting to show occasional CPU spikes and disk pressure during business hours.

Your task:
🛑 Detect performance issues before they become incidents.
🔔 Alert the on-call engineer via SNS the moment thresholds are breached.
📊 Build dashboards for the DevOps team to track trends and resolve root causes.

This repo is your weaponized response. ⚔️

⚙️ What’s Inside
Feature	Description
EC2 Setup	Launch an EC2 instance to monitor
CloudWatch Agent Config	Collect memory, disk, CPU metrics
Custom Metrics	Go beyond default—track disk space, memory
CloudWatch Alarms	Define thresholds to trigger proactive alerts
SNS Notification	Send alerts to on-call engineer (SMS/email)
Dashboard Setup	Visualize system health trends like a boss

🚀 How to Deploy
1. 🖥️ Launch EC2 + Install CloudWatch Agent
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y amazon-cloudwatch-agent
Copy in your cloudwatch-agent-config.json, then start the agent:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl \
 -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c file:cloudwatch-agent-config.json -s
2. 📊 Create Alarms
Example: High CPU (over 80% for 5 minutes)

bash
Copy
Edit
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
 --alarm-name "HighCPUAlarm" \
 --metric-name CPUUtilization \
 --namespace AWS/EC2 \
 --statistic Average \
 --period 300 \
 --threshold 80 \
 --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
 --evaluation-periods 1 \
 --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-0123456789abcdef0 \
 --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MySNSTopic
3. 📬 Set Up SNS Notifications
bash
Copy
Edit
aws sns create-topic --name MySNSTopic
aws sns subscribe \
 --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MySNSTopic \
 --protocol email \
 --notification-endpoint your.email@example.com
✅ Success Criteria
✅ You get notified within seconds of a high CPU event

✅ Alarm shows up in CloudWatch console

✅ You can track metrics visually via dashboard

✅ App remains up and healthy—users never know there was a problem 😎
